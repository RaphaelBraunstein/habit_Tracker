## Main.py

The main.py file is a python script that simply runs an endless while-loop, which takes a numeric input from the user and based on that decides which command to run.
Before the loop, the program prints a little Hello message and the currently tracked habits.
<br> After that, it prints a list with every command you can run. Further instructions are followed after you type in the number of the command.
